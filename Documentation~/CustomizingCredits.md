  # Customizing Credits
</div>

The credits can be customized using the credits settings, which can be located in the Project Settings under "Credits", or in the credits settings object, which is automatically generated in the "Assets/Settings" folder.

> [!Important]
> Editing the credits settings during runtime is highly discouraged. This is because that any changes you make during play mode will persist when you return to edit mode, causing any changes made to be semi-permenant.

Alongside the contents of the credits, the credits settings gives you A few properties to play with as well, such as the music track & text font.

> [!Warning]
> A music track must be provided, otherwise the Credits System will break during playback.

<!--
> [!Note]
> In Unity 6.0 and beyond, the music property will be an AudioResource instead of an AudioClip, although AudioClip's will still be accepted.
